🚀 Sales Route Optimization & Geolocation Engine (Python)
📌 Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end sales route optimization system built in Python, designed to solve real-world field sales and territory planning challenges.

It integrates a company name–based geolocation engine, open-source routing, and interactive visualizations to optimize multi-representative routes under time and travel constraints.

The solution is built with production-style structure, separating raw data, processing logic, analytics notebooks, and business-ready outputs.

🎯 Business Problem

Sales and field teams often rely on manual spreadsheets and static maps to plan daily routes, leading to:

Inefficient travel paths

Uneven territory allocation

Lost selling time

Poor scalability as customer lists grow

This project automates the entire workflow — from location resolution to optimized routing and visualization.
